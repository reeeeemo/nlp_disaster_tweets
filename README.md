# nlp_disaster_tweets
Notebook describing text classification of whether a tweet is related to a disaster or not. Made for the NLP with Disaster Tweets [Kaggle Playground](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started).

# Problem Overview
In this competition, we are challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which tweets are referencing real disasters or not.

For this playground, I have used 3 separate models: A custom Logistic Regression / XGBoost, a custom LSTM model, and a pretrained model by Keras called DistilBERT.
